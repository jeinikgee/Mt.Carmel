<p>
	The Our Lady of Mt. Carmel Montessori is a Catholic School owned and operated by Miss Dona Digna S. Rosario, a former religious sister of the congregation of Italian origin-the Daughters of St. Mary of Leuca.
The school was founded in May 1986 upon the encouragement and recommendation of the then DECS Regional Director, Dr. Bernardo Reyes. It began to operate first as a pre-school under Government Permit No. EE-06- s. 1986 with 67 pupils, then, under another teacher besides Teacher Dona, as she was fondly called. In 1987 while on its second year of operation, the population increased by 100 percent and subsequently, in July of that same year, the DECS granted OLMCM official recognition under G. R. No. PS-035.
</p>
<p>
The year 1989 ushered in the opening of its complete elementary course under Government Permit No. EED 0010 s. 1989.  And on 26 February of the following year (1990), it was granted Government Recognition No. EED R0004, thus, completing the curricular offerings from Pre-school to Grade six.
Six years after its establishment and having consolidated its course offerings, faculty of instruction and facilities, OLMCM geared towards institutional memberships and affiliations. On February 10, 1994, the school became a member of the Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP).
Then, the year 2003 proved to be another milestone for the school when the secondary level of education was finally offered to Carmelian graduates who wanted to continue their Christian formation by staying with their Alma Mater this time as high school students.
</p>
<p>
In the same year, the school was also admitted as an institutional member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization- Asia Pacific Network for International Education and Values Education (UNESCO-APNlEVE), a UN body aimed at developing “peace founded upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of humanity.”
From its humble beginnings, the school continues to grow and strive for excellence in its academic and co-curricular programs. Through the abled leadership of Teacher Dona, OLMCM continually exerts all efforts to be of service to the learning community striving to provide updated, relevant and holistic education for the students under its care.

<p>
	When Miss Dona Digna Rosario was still with the congregation of the Daughters of Mary of Leuca, she established in the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish in New Manila, Quezon City, a parish-based pre-school for indigent children, which was to bear the same name. It was in the Our Lady of Mount Carmel Parish Pre-School, working with the children of poor families,  that she would later discover her fulfillment learning to love them—a task she would do early on out of duty. Thus, when the “call” to found her own school, she decided to name it for Our Lady of Mount Carmel, from whose hands she attributes that change of heart and of whose constant guidance and protection she would recognize in the years to come.
